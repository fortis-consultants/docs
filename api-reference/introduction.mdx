## Welcome

The Fortis Evaluations API allows you to programmatically access your orders, quotes, documents, and user information.

## Base URL

```
https://api.fortiseval.com/v1
```

For testing purposes, you can use the sandbox environment:

```
https://sandbox.fortiseval.com/v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.fortiseval.com/v1/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Testing Your Connection

Use the [Ping endpoint](/api-reference/ping/index) to verify your API credentials are working correctly.
